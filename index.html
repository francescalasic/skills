            <div class="skill-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i></div>
                <h3>Communicating</h3>
                <p>During Project 1, I actively participated in the workgroup, proposing my ideas and contributing significantly to the design phase. At the same time, I always valued listening to others' proposals, seeking to integrate different perspectives into shared solutions. I used sketches and drawings to facilitate visual communication, making project proposals immediately understandable. Additionally, I had the opportunity to present our work during the university demo day, explaining the project to visitors and students. This experience allowed me to practice public communication and clearly convey not only how the product works but also its values and the process that generated it. I am comfortable presenting my ideas in public, but I am also an attentive observer and listener, which allows me to value others' contributions and work collaboratively.</p>

                <h3>Collaborating</h3>
                <p>Within work teams, I play an active role in maintaining a positive collaborative dynamic, encouraging every member to contribute and promoting an inclusive environment. I facilitate dialogue through shared sketches and prototypes that transform abstract ideas into tangible solutions, creating a concrete basis for discussion. Additionally, I balance my personal creativity with the group's common goals, ensuring that every design decision aligns with a shared vision.</p>

            <div class="skill-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i></div>
                <h3>Planning and Organizing</h3>
                <p>A project requires careful planning of its various development phases. During Project 1, I actively participated in organizing the teamâ€™s work, dividing tasks, meeting deadlines, and monitoring the project timeline. Specifically, designing and creating the game box required continuous evaluation of timelines, priorities, and materials, demonstrating my ability to adapt and reorganize based on feedback and intermediate results.</p>

            <!-- Dealing with Scientific Information -->
            <div class="skill-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-flask"></i></div>
                <h3>Dealing with Scientific Information</h3>
                <p>During the technical development phase of the device, I collaborated with the team to integrate electronic components like the color sensor and ESP32-S3 module, tackling electronic design for the first time. I followed the process with great interest, learning to understand technical specifications, calibration issues, and power management. This allowed me to begin navigating the world of scientific and technical information, developing the ability to apply engineering knowledge in a user-oriented design context.</p>

            <!-- Reflecting -->
            <div class="skill-section">
                <div class="icon"><i class="fas fa-think"></i></div>
                <h3>Reflecting</h3>
                <p>Project 1 was a highly formative experience that allowed me to critically reflect on my design choices, both aesthetically and functionally. I repeatedly revised the design of the box and device based on feedback received, embracing criticism as an opportunity for improvement. Additionally, defining the target audience and conducting user research helped me understand the importance of designing with empathy and awareness. This reflection has strengthened my vision of responsible, sustainable design deeply connected to people's real needs.</p>
